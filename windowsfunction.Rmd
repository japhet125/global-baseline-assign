# Approach

For this analysis,with the help of llms I will use a dataset containing daily closing prices of
multiple cryptocurrencies from January 1, 2022 generated by llm. The goal is to calculate:

1. **Year-to-date (YTD) average price** for each cryptocurrency.
2. **Six-day moving average** for each cryptocurrency.

We will achieve this using **window functions** in `dplyr`.

```r
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(tidyr)

# Example: Generate a sample dataset
set.seed(123)
dates <- seq.Date(from = as.Date("2022-01-01"), to = as.Date("2022-12-31"), by = "day")
crypto <- c("Bitcoin", "Ethereum")
data <- expand.grid(date = dates, crypto = crypto)

# Simulate daily closing prices
data$price <- round(runif(nrow(data), 1000, 50000), 2)

# Preview dataset
head(data)
