# Approach

For this assignment, I will use the **MovieLens 100k dataset**, which is 
straightforward to manipulate and provides an excellent opportunity to practice
data handling and analysis. The dataset will be downloaded and stored in my 
GitHub repository, allowing me to access the raw data directly.

The workflow for this analysis is as follows:

1. **Data Loading and Preparation:**  
   I will load the dataset into R using the `dplyr` and `tidyr` libraries.
   After loading, I will reformat the data to match the requirements of this
   assignment.

2. **Global Baseline Computation:**  
   - Calculate the **global mean rating**.  
   - Compute **user bias** and **movie bias**.

3. **Prediction of Ratings:**  
   Using the global baseline, I will predict missing ratings for recommendation 
   purposes.

```r
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)

# Load the dataset from GitHub
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/japhet125/global-baseline-assign/refs/heads/main/u.data"

ratings <- read_delim(
  url,
  delim = "\t",
  col_names = c("userId", "movieId", "rating", "timestamp")
)

# Keep only the relevant columns
ratings <- ratings[, c("userId", "movieId", "rating")]

# Preview the dataset
head(ratings)
